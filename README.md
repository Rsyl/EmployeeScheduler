# EmployeeScheduler
In a nut shell, it is a desktop app that allows employers to schedule employees with various time availabilities.

The problem: 
Scheduling 12 different people with different availabilities is time consuming and sometimes frustrating.

The solution:
Put these all in a database and provide a UI so its more visible and selectable.


*Forewords*
The purpose of the making this app was to experiment with making desktop applications. Though there are definitely faster ways of doing them know, I decided to manually code the GUI using Java Swing to better understand how actionListeners, grid_layouts and etc work. It was also a way to practice some Object-Oriented programming. 

When I first planned the project, I had wanted to include more features. However, since I'm currently going through Software Engineering 2 and having spoken to people who could potentially leverage this tiny app. A fortiori, I've decided to reduce the scale and focus on making an MVP. 

I also heavily comment on my code just in case I need to jog the memory of my future self.
